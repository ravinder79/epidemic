#Disclaimer: This is my dabblings with simulating various scenarios for a epidemic. These are just toy models and I don't claim that they represent the real world epidemics. But these simulations can provide high level insights into effect of social distancing, quarantine and travel on spread of an epidemic.

# Simulation of epidemics/pandemics

## Description of various .py files:

### epidemic.py: Simulation of basic epidemic

### epidemic_window.py : Simulation will added visulaization of number of infected/removed. Added option for social distancing

### epidemic_window_qt.py: Simulation will quarantine scenario added

### epidemic_window_qt_c.py: Simulation where ppl visit a central location (quarantine/social isolation optional)

### epidemic_cities.py: Simulation with travel between cities
